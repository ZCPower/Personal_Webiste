            <p>I'm 27 and I currently reside in Conroe which is about 45 minutes north of Houston. I love to spend what little free time I have by going out with my girlfriend, hanging out with our dogs, exercising, or playing video games with my pals. I currently work in healthcare and am trying to transition into a role as a developer in tech.</p>
