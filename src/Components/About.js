            <p className='aboutParagraph'>Hello! I am Zach Power. I graduated with my Bachelor's in Kinesiology and Health Promotion in May 2020. After graduation, I worked a few healthcare jobs and had plans of eventually pursuing a Doctorate in Physical Therapy. I eventually decided that going to school for 3 more years and racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in students loans was not the route I wanted to pursue.</p>
